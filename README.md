The CompetitorsModernView is a comprehensive competitor tracking and analysis interface designed for sailboat racing. This view provides real-time competitor monitoring, tactical analysis, and race management capabilities.

## Main Interface Overview

### Header Section
The interface displays key status information at the top:
- **Total competitors count** with breakdown by category
- **Current race information** including race name, ID, scoring system, class, and flags
- **Action buttons** for importing data, adding competitors, and managing the database

- **Total** (Blue): Complete competitor count

### Search and Sorting
- **Search bar**: Filter competitors by name or MMSI number
- **Sort controls**: Sort competitors by multiple criteria (name, distance, threat level, etc.) with ascending/descending options

## Competitor Sections

### Our Boat Section
When your boat is found in the competitor database and marked as racing, it displays:
- **Own boat card** with comprehensive race timing information
- **Elapsed time** since race start
- **Corrected time** calculations using TCF (Time Correction Factor)

## Tactical Analysis Calculations

### DISTANCE AHEAD
The **DISTANCE AHEAD** metric shows the positional advantage between your boat and competitors measured along the race course.

**Calculation Method:**
- Measures the direct distance from each boat to the active race mark
- Subtracts your distance from the competitor's distance to the mark
- **Positive values** (+): You are ahead (closer to the mark than the competitor)
- **Negative values** (-): You are behind (competitor is closer to the mark)
- Displayed in nautical miles with one decimal precision (e.g., "+0.3nm", "-1.2nm")

**Prerequisites:**
- Both boats must be marked as "racing"
- Both boats must have valid GPS positions
- Both boats must be determined to be on the same race leg
- Active mark coordinates must be available

**Same Leg Detection:**
The system uses VMC (Velocity Made to Course) analysis to determine if boats are racing the same leg:
- Both boats must have positive VMC toward the active mark
- VMC difference between boats must be within reasonable tactical variation
- Boats with strongly negative VMC are considered to be on different legs

### TIME AHEAD
The **TIME AHEAD** metric shows the corrected time advantage/disadvantage in the current race standings.

**Calculation Method:**
1. **Position-Adjusted Corrected Time Analysis:**
  - Calculates each boat's corrected elapsed time using their respective TCF (Time Correction Factor)
  - For boats at different distances from the mark, projects the time needed for the trailing boat to reach the leading boat's position
  - Uses current VMC to estimate catch-up time
  - Applies TCF to both current elapsed time and projected time

2. **Calculation Logic:**
  - If you're ahead by distance: Projects competitor's time to reach your position, then compares corrected times
  - If competitor is ahead: Projects your time to reach their position, then compares corrected times
  - If positions are similar (<100m difference): Uses direct corrected time comparison

3. **Display Format:**
  - **Positive values** (+): You are ahead on corrected time (winning)
  - **Negative values** (-): Competitor is ahead on corrected time (you need to catch up)
  - Formatted as MM:SS for times over 1 minute, or 0:SS for shorter intervals
  - Green text for positive (ahead), red text for negative (behind)

**Prerequisites:**
- Both boats must have valid TCF values from their handicap ratings
- Race must have started (elapsed time available)
- Both boats must have reasonable VMC values (>0.5 knots) for projection calculations
- Boats must be on the same race leg

### Lateral Separation (LAT SEP)
Shows the perpendicular distance from each boats current position to the rhumb line:
- **Positive values with "P"**: Boat is to port of the course line
- **Negative values with "S"**: Boat is to starboard of the course line
- Helps identify tactical positioning and potential crossing situations

## Key Features

### Data Import Capabilities
- **CSV Import**: Import competitor lists from spreadsheet files
- **YachtScoring Integration**: Direct connection to YachtScoring platform for race data
- **ORC Rating Fetch**: Automatic retrieval of ORC ratings and TCF values

### Race Configuration
The view automatically adapts to race settings configured elsewhere in the application:
- Race name and identifier
- Scoring system selection
- Class configuration
- Mark positions for tactical calculations

## Technical Notes

### Data Requirements
For tactical calculations to function properly, the system requires:
- Valid GPS positions for all boats
- TCF values from handicap ratings (ORC/PHRF)
- Active race mark coordinates
- Race start time for elapsed time calculations

### Limitations
- Tactical calculations only apply to boats on the same race leg
- Time projections assume current VMC will be maintained
- Very low VMC conditions (<0.5 knots) may result in unreliable projections
- Boats with missing TCF values will show "---" for corrected time calculations

This interface provides professional-level competitor analysis capabilities suitable for serious racing sailors who need comprehensive tactical information during races.

### üó∫Ô∏è Sails - Inventory and Event Management

**Sail Crossover Chart**

<p>The app supports two types of crossover charts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designer Crossover Chart</li>
  <p>Based on sail usage recommendations from your sailmaker. This chart reflects the theoretical or intended wind ranges for each sail.</p>
  <li>Performance Crossover Chart</li>
  <p>Built from real sailing data collected during your races or sessions, this view shows the true wind angles (TWA) and true wind speeds (TWS) at which each sail was used. When multiple sails are used in overlapping conditions, the sail associated with the highest boatspeed is shown. This data can be easily aggregated and downloaded from the Sail Analytics, see https://app.sailnjord.com/help/analytics/visualizations/sail-crossover.html?highlight=crossover#sail-crossover</p>
</ul>

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/swp-sail-crossover-light.png" width="448"/>
</div>

- **Inventory**: Each time you import a sail crossover chart, the app updates the sail inventory based on the sails found in the XML file. You can then enable or disable sails, or designate which sails are left on shore for any particular race.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/swp-sail-inventory-light.png" width="448"/>
</div>

- **Events**: Once you import your sail chart, you can begin entering Sail Up events with corresponding time and location. The event log file can then be uploaded to https://www.sailnjord.com/.

<div align="center">

### üå¨Ô∏è Wind Analysis
*Comprehensive wind monitoring and trend analysis*

<div align="center">
 <img src="images/swp-wind-state.png" width="448"/>
</div>

**Real-Time Wind Cards**
- **Wind Data Manager**: Manage wind instrument data and seamlessly share it among your crew. When the app starts, each connected device receives a rolling wind database initialized by the first device to launch the app. This database captures real-time wind instrument readings and maintains a continuous 6-hour history. New devices sync with the longest-running device to access all data collected since that device started. If the longest-running device disconnects, the next longest-running device takes over as the sync source‚Äîensuring uninterrupted sharing and synchronization of wind data across the network..
 
- **TWD**: True Wind Direction (degrees)
- **TWS**: True Wind Speed (knots)  
- **Wind Trend Analyzer**: Current shift pattern with confidence indicator.
- # Wind Trend Analysis

## How the Program Determines Wind Trends

## 1. Data Collection
The program looks at recent wind data within a specified time window (default 15 minutes):
- **TWD data** (True Wind Direction) - what direction the wind is coming from
- **TWS data** (True Wind Speed) - how fast the wind is blowing

## 2. Direction Trend Analysis
For wind direction, it:
- Calculates how much the wind direction has changed between consecutive readings
- Handles the circular nature of wind (359¬∞ to 0¬∞ is actually just 1¬∞ change, not 359¬∞)
- Looks for patterns:
  - **Steady**: Wind direction changes less than 5¬∞
  - **Backing**: Wind shifts counter-clockwise (e.g., from north to west)
  - **Veering**: Wind shifts clockwise (e.g., from north to east)
  - **Oscillating**: Wind "wobbles" back and forth repeatedly

## 3. Intensity Trend Analysis
For wind speed, it:
- Calculates the overall change in speed over the time period
- Measures how much the speed varies (to detect gusting)
- Determines patterns:
  - **Steady**: Speed changes less than 1 knot
  - **Building**: Wind is getting stronger (more than 1 knot increase)
  - **Dissipating**: Wind is getting weaker (more than 1 knot decrease)
  - **Gusting**: Speed varies a lot, even if the average doesn't change much

## 4. Confidence Calculation
The program calculates its confidence in the trend based on the amount of data it has - more data points result in higher confidence.

## 5. Final Result
It combines both analyses into a single trend description like `VER15¬∞/BLD+2.5`, meaning "Wind veering 15 degrees while building 2.5 knots"

The key insight is that it examines the **overall pattern** of change over time, rather than just individual readings, and properly accounts for the circular nature of wind direction measurements.

**Barometer**: This view tracks and records atmospheric pressure in real-time, displaying a visual history of pressure changes. This record is vital for anticipating storms and squalls: A rapid drop in barometric pressure is often a strong indicator of an approaching low-pressure system, which can bring strong winds and inclement weather. By monitoring this downward trend on the barograph, sailors gain valuable lead time to take precautions, like securing the vessel and reefing sails.  The app also alerts users when the data interface for this channel stops receiving updates, preventing false assumptions of stable pressure.

### ‚õµ Performance Analysis Tools

**Polars**
- Real-time polar performance analysis
- Target speeds and angles for current conditions
- Performance percentage against theoretical maximums

### üå°Ô∏è Weather Tools

- **Weather Data Manager**: Any user can retrieve wind and weather data, including historical data, from buoys within 100 nautical miles of your boat‚Äôs position. The app shares the latest buoy readings with all crew members through the boat‚Äôs local WiFi network. When any user refreshes the data, the updated readings are automatically shared with all app users on the same network, ensuring all decision-makers view the same dataset.  To date, we have extracted weather data from NDBC buoys from NOAA CoastWatch ERDDAP (standard NDBC network), NDBC stations via AXDS ERDDAP, LISICOS buoys (UConn direct) using OCR, NERACOOS datasets (Gulf of Maine area), and NDBC stations available through NERACOOS. We can easily adapt more buoys as required. The Navigator view map overlays the buoy data with the boat's current position and race course so your Navigator can investigate the wind trends of nearby future locations to help optimize the route.

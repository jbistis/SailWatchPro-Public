## Features

### üìä Dashboard

<div align="center">
 <img src="images/swp-dashboard-light.png" width="384"/>  
</div>

The above dashboard is divided into the sections:

<ol>
  <li>Key Performance Indicators</li>
      <p>The top row of dashboard cards change colors based on how closely your sailing data aligns with recommended target values. The cards dynamically display relevant data, showing upwind metrics when sailing upwind and downwind metrics when sailing downwind.</p>
  <li>Custom Data Fields</li>
    <p>The custom fields let you pick and choose which Expedition Marine channels you want to show and where color coded to group like objects together.</p>
  <li>Compass Rose</li>
    <p>This section provides a visual representation of how you're driving to target versus actual angles for both AWA and TWA.  Also shows TWD and how the current set and drift are impacting the boat.</p>
</ol>

**Key Insight**: The dashboard automatically switches data priorities based on your sailing mode (upwind/reaching/downwind) and provides color feedback based on out of bounds conditions.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Pre-Start

<p>The Prestart view is where you ping the pin, select the racecouse, and set and sync the race timer clock.</p>

<div align="center">

<div align="center">
 <img src="images/swp-wind-state.png" width="384"/>
</div>

**Real-Time Wind Cards**
- **Wind Data Manager**: Seamlessly manage wind instrument data and share and share amoung your crew. Each connected device maintains a rolling wind database, initialized when the first device launches the app and capturing real-time wind instrument readings. The database accumulates and maintains a rolling 6 hours of wind instrument data over time. New devices sync with the longest-running device to acquire all data collected since the longest-running device started. If the longest-running device exits, the next longest-running device becomes the sync device, maintaining seamless synchronization of the 6 hour database for new connections without disrupting the distributed database.
 
- **TWD**: True Wind Direction (degrees)
- **TWS**: True Wind Speed (knots)  
- **Wind Trend Analyzer**: Current shift pattern with confidence indicator.

**Vertical Strip Charts**
- **Time-based Analysis**: Configurable time windows (2 min to 6 hours)
- **Rolling Average**: Smoothed trend line showing underlying patterns
- **Statistical Data**: High, low, and average values for each parameter
- **Tactical Insights**: Identify wind shifts before they fully develop

**Chart Features**
- **Green Line**: Raw wind data showing all fluctuations
- **Magenta Dotted Line**: Rolling average for trend identification
- **Background Grid**: Easy reference for value and time scales
- **Interactive Time Selection**: Tap time labels to adjust viewing window

**Barometer**: This view continuously tracks and records atmospheric pressure, displaying a visual history of pressure changes. This record is vital for anticipating storms and squalls: A rapid drop in barometric pressure is often a strong indicator of an approaching low-pressure system, which can bring strong winds and inclement weather. By monitoring this downward trend on the barograph, sailors gain valuable lead time to take precautions, like securing the vessel and reefing sails.  The app also alerts users when the data interface for this channel stops receiving updates, preventing false assumptions of stable pressure.

### ‚õµ Performance Analysis Tools

**Sail Crossover**
- Optimal sail selection based on current conditions
- Performance comparisons between sail options
- Wind range recommendations for each sail

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/swp-sail-crossover-light.png" width="384"/>
</div>

**Polars**

- Performance percentage against theoretical maximums

**Sails**
- Import your Expedition Marine xml for Sail inventory management.
- Sail events and usage tracking and performance data with export to Sail Analytics.

### üå°Ô∏è Weather Tools
- **Weather Data Manager**: Any user can retrieve wind and weather data, including historical data, from buoys within 100 nautical miles of your boat‚Äôs position. The app shares the latest buoy readings with all crew members through the boat‚Äôs local WiFi network. When any user refreshes the data, the updated readings are automatically shared with all app users on the same network, ensuring all decision-makers view the same dataset.  To date, we have extrated weather data from NDBC buoys from NOAA CoastWatch ERDDAP (standard NDBC network), NDBC stations via AXDS ERDDAP, LISICOS buoys (UConn direct) using OCR, NERACOOS datasets (Gulf of Maine area), and NDBC stations available through NERACOOS. We can easily adapt more buoys as required. The Navigator view map overylays the buoy data with the boat's current position and race course so your Navigator can investiage the wind trends of nearby future locations to help optimze the route.

## Tips for Racing

### Start Line
1. **Set your pins early** in the race preparation sequence
2. **Monitor line bias continuously** - it changes with wind shifts
3. **Use the "Distance Below Line" indicator** to avoid OCS

### Wind Analysis
1. **Watch the rolling average line** for underlying wind trends
2. **Use longer time windows** (10+ minutes) for strategy, shorter (2-5 minutes) for tactics
3. **Monitor wind trend confidence indicators** - higher confidence = more reliable shift
4. **Combine wind data with competitor analysis** for tactical decisions

### Performance Optimization
1. **Check polar percentages regularly** to ensure optimal performance
2. **Use VMG data** for upwind/downwind optimization
3. **Monitor heel angle** for optimal sail trim
4. **Track depth closely** in shallow water racing

### Data Management
1. **Start with test mode** to familiarize yourself with interfaces
2. **Configure time windows** based on your racing style and conditions
3. **Use night mode** for dawn/dusk racing and night sailing
4. **Keep critical data cards** in your primary views

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Red status indicators**: Check IP address and UDP port settings
- **No data reception**: Verify Expedition Marine is broadcasting data
- **Intermittent connection**: Check WiFi signal strength and network stability

### Display Problems

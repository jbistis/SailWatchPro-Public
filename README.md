</div>

The above dashboard is divided into the following sections:

<ol>
  <li>Key Performance Indicators</li>
      <p>Each dashboard cards change colors based on how closely your sailing data aligns with recommended target values. The cards dynamically display relevant data, showing upwind metrics when sailing upwind and downwind metrics when sailing downwind.</p>
  <li>Custom Data Fields</li>
    <p>The custom fields let you pick and choose which Expedition Marine channels you want to show and where they are color-coded to group like objects together.</p>
  <li>Compass Rose</li>
    <p>This section provides a visual representation of how you're driving to the target versus actual angles for both AWA and TWA.  Also shows TWD and how the current set and drift are impacting the boat.</p>
</ol>

**Key Insight**: The dashboard automatically switches data priorities based on your sailing mode (upwind/reaching/downwind) and provides color feedback based on out-of-bounds conditions.

### üó∫Ô∏è Sails - Inventory and Event Management

**Sail Crossover Chart**

<p>The app supports two types of crossover charts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designer Crossover Chart</li>
  <p>Based on sail usage recommendations from your sailmaker. This chart reflects the theoretical or intended wind ranges for each sail.</p>
  <li>Performance Crossover Chart</li>
  <p>Built from real sailing data collected during your races or sessions, this view shows the true wind angles (TWA) and true wind speeds (TWS) at which each sail was used. When multiple sails are used in overlapping conditions, the sail associated with the highest boatspeed is shown. This data can be easily aggregated and downloaded from the Sail Analytics, see https://app.sailnjord.com/help/analytics/visualizations/sail-crossover.html?highlight=crossover#sail-crossover</p>
</ul>

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/swp-sail-crossover-light.png" width="448"/>
</div>

- **Inventory**: Each time you import a sail crossover chart, the app updates the sail inventory based on the sails found in the XML file. You can then enable or disable sails, or designate which sails are left on shore for any particular race.

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/swp-sail-inventory-light.png" width="448"/>
</div>

- **Events**: Once you import your sail chart, you can begin entering Sail Up events with corresponding time and location. The event log file can then be uploaded to https://www.sailnjord.com/.

### üå¨Ô∏è Wind Analysis
*Comprehensive wind monitoring and trend analysis*

<div align="center">
 <img src="images/swp-wind-state.png" width="448"/>
</div>

**Real-Time Wind Cards**
- **Wind Data Manager**: Manage wind instrument data and seamlessly share it among your crew. When the app starts, each connected device receives a rolling wind database initialized by the first device to launch the app. This database captures real-time wind instrument readings and maintains a continuous 6-hour history. New devices sync with the longest-running device to access all data collected since that device started. If the longest-running device disconnects, the next longest-running device takes over as the sync source‚Äîensuring uninterrupted sharing and synchronization of wind data across the network..
 
- **TWD**: True Wind Direction (degrees)
- **TWS**: True Wind Speed (knots)  
- **Wind Trend Analyzer**: Current shift pattern with confidence indicator.
- # Wind Trend Analysis

## How the Program Determines Wind Trends

## 1. Data Collection
The program looks at recent wind data within a specified time window (default 15 minutes):
- **TWD data** (True Wind Direction) - what direction the wind is coming from
- **TWS data** (True Wind Speed) - how fast the wind is blowing

## 2. Direction Trend Analysis
For wind direction, it:
- Calculates how much the wind direction has changed between consecutive readings
- Handles the circular nature of wind (359¬∞ to 0¬∞ is actually just 1¬∞ change, not 359¬∞)
- Looks for patterns:
  - **Steady**: Wind direction changes less than 5¬∞
  - **Backing**: Wind shifts counter-clockwise (e.g., from north to west)
  - **Veering**: Wind shifts clockwise (e.g., from north to east)
  - **Oscillating**: Wind "wobbles" back and forth repeatedly

## 3. Intensity Trend Analysis
For wind speed, it:
- Calculates the overall change in speed over the time period
- Measures how much the speed varies (to detect gusting)
- Determines patterns:
  - **Steady**: Speed changes less than 1 knot
  - **Building**: Wind is getting stronger (more than 1 knot increase)
  - **Dissipating**: Wind is getting weaker (more than 1 knot decrease)
  - **Gusting**: Speed varies a lot, even if the average doesn't change much

## 4. Confidence Calculation
The program calculates how confident it is in the trend based on how much data it has - more data points = higher confidence.

## 5. Final Result
It combines both analyses into a single trend description like `VER15¬∞/BLD+2.5`, meaning "Wind veering 15 degrees while building 2.5 knots"

The key insight is that it looks at the **overall pattern** of change over time, not just individual readings, and properly handles the circular nature of wind direction measurements.

## Trend Types

### Wind Direction Trends
- `.backing(degrees: Double)` - Counter-clockwise shift
- `.veering(degrees: Double)` - Clockwise shift
- `.oscillating(range: Double)` - Back & forth within range
- `.steady` - Consistent direction

### Wind Intensity Trends
- `.building(rate: Double)` - Increasing (kts over period)
- `.dissipating(rate: Double)` - Decreasing (kts over period)
- `.gusting(variance: Double)` - High short-term variance
- `.steady` - Consistent speed

- **Braometric Pressure**: Continuously tracks and records atmospheric pressure

**Vertical Strip Charts**
- **Time-based Analysis**: Configurable time windows (2 min to 6 hours)
- **Rolling Average**: Smoothed trend line showing underlying patterns
- **Statistical Data**: High, low, and average values for each parameter
- **Tactical Insights**: Identify wind shifts before they fully develop

**Chart Features**
- **Green Line**: Raw wind data showing all fluctuations
- **Magenta Dotted Line**: Rolling average for trend identification
- **Background Grid**: Easy reference for value and time scales
- **Interactive Time Selection**: Tap time labels to adjust the viewing window

**Barometer**: This view tracks and records atmospheric pressure in real-time, displaying a visual history of pressure changes. This record is vital for anticipating storms and squalls: A rapid drop in barometric pressure is often a strong indicator of an approaching low-pressure system, which can bring strong winds and inclement weather. By monitoring this downward trend on the barograph, sailors gain valuable lead time to take precautions, like securing the vessel and reefing sails.  The app also alerts users when the data interface for this channel stops receiving updates, preventing false assumptions of stable pressure.

### ‚õµ Performance Analysis Tools

**Polars**
- Real-time polar performance analysis
- Target speeds and angles for current conditions
- Performance percentage against theoretical maximums

### üå°Ô∏è Weather Tools

- **Weather Data Manager**: Any user can retrieve wind and weather data, including historical data, from buoys within 100 nautical miles of your boat‚Äôs position. The app shares the latest buoy readings with all crew members through the boat‚Äôs local WiFi network. When any user refreshes the data, the updated readings are automatically shared with all app users on the same network, ensuring all decision-makers view the same dataset.  To date, we have extracted weather data from NDBC buoys from NOAA CoastWatch ERDDAP (standard NDBC network), NDBC stations via AXDS ERDDAP, LISICOS buoys (UConn direct) using OCR, NERACOOS datasets (Gulf of Maine area), and NDBC stations available through NERACOOS. We can easily adapt more buoys as required. The Navigator view map overlays the buoy data with the boat's current position and race course so your Navigator can investigate the wind trends of nearby future locations to help optimize the route.

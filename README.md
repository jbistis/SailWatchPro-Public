**Real-Time Wind Cards**
- **Wind Data Manager**: Seamlessly manage wind instrument data and share and share amoung your crew. Each connected device maintains a rolling wind database, initialized when the first device launches the app and capturing real-time wind instrument readings. The database accumulates and maintains a rolling 6 hours of wind instrument data over time. New devices sync with the longest-running device to acquire all data collected since the longest-running device started. If the longest-running device exits, the next longest-running device becomes the sync device, maintaining seamless synchronization of the 6 hour database for new connections without disrupting the distributed database.
 
- **TWD**: True Wind Direction (degrees)
- **TWS**: True Wind Speed (knots)  
- **Wind Trend Analyzer**: Current shift pattern with confidence indicator.

### üå°Ô∏è Weather Tools
- **Weather Data Manager**: Any user can retrieve wind and weather data, including historical data, from buoys within 100 nautical miles of your boat‚Äôs position. The app shares the latest buoy readings with all crew members through the boat‚Äôs local WiFi network. When any user refreshes the data, the updated readings are automatically shared with all app users on the same network, ensuring all decision-makers view the same dataset.  To date, we have extrated weather data from NDBC buoys from NOAA CoastWatch ERDDAP (standard NDBC network), NDBC stations via AXDS ERDDAP, LISICOS buoys (UConn direct) using OCR, NERACOOS datasets (Gulf of Maine area), and NDBC stations available through NERACOOS. We can easily adapt more buoys as required. The Navigator view map overylays the buoy data with the boat's current position and race course so your Navigator can investiage the wind trends of nearby future locations to help optimze the route.

## Tips for Racing

### Start Line
1. **Set your pins early** in the race preparation sequence
2. **Monitor line bias continuously** - it changes with wind shifts
3. **Use the "Distance Below Line" indicator** to avoid OCS

### Wind Analysis
1. **Watch the rolling average line** for underlying wind trends
2. **Use longer time windows** (10+ minutes) for strategy, shorter (2-5 minutes) for tactics
3. **Monitor wind trend confidence indicators** - higher confidence = more reliable shift
4. **Combine wind data with competitor analysis** for tactical decisions

### Performance Optimization
1. **Check polar percentages regularly** to ensure optimal performance
2. **Use VMG data** for upwind/downwind optimization
3. **Monitor heel angle** for optimal sail trim
4. **Track depth closely** in shallow water racing

### Data Management
1. **Start with test mode** to familiarize yourself with interfaces
2. **Configure time windows** based on your racing style and conditions
3. **Use night mode** for dawn/dusk racing and night sailing
4. **Keep critical data cards** in your primary views

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Red status indicators**: Check IP address and UDP port settings
- **No data reception**: Verify Expedition Marine is broadcasting data
- **Intermittent connection**: Check WiFi signal strength and network stability

### Display Problems
